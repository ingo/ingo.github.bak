Growing up, Ingo would often ask his dad to make the roast beef, slice it thinly, and then pile it high on two slices of San Luis Sourdough bread for\u00a0a special French Dip treat. This recipe for roast beef comes by way of the Culinary Institute of America&#8217;s The New Professional Chef. The method is\u00a0fairly foolproof, and yields a good roast with a large pink center &#8211; perfect for a French Dip.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"hrecipe h-recipe jetpack-recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\"><h3 class=\"p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Roast Beef Au Jus<\/h3><ul class=\"jetpack-recipe-meta\"><li class=\"jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield\" itemprop=\"recipeYield\"><strong>Servings: <\/strong>3-4 lbs.<\/li><li class=\"jetpack-recipe-print\"><a href=\"#\">Print<\/a><\/li><\/ul><div class=\"jetpack-recipe-content\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><div class=\"jetpack-recipe-ingredients\"><h4 class=\"jetpack-recipe-ingredients-title\">Ingredients<\/h4><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>1 4-5 beef roast, top sirloin preferred<\/li><li>1 tsp. olive oil<\/li><li>1 clove garlic<\/li><li>1 tsp. salt<\/li><li>1\/2 tsp. pepper<\/li><li>1\/2 onion<\/li><li>1 stalk celery<\/li><li>1 carrot<\/li><li>1 tbsp.

Mash the garlic into a paste and coat the roast. Season all over with salt and pepper.<\/li><li>Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan and brown the roast on all sides. Place the roast in a roasting pan on a wire rack in the oven, and roast until the beef reaches an internal temperature of 100 F. Meanwhile, chop the onion, celery and carrots into a medium dice. Once the roast reaches 100 degrees, add the onion, celery and carrot mixture to the pan along with 1 cup of water. Return the pan to the oven, and continue roasting until the internal temperature reaches 125 F. If the water evaporates, add another cup.<\/li><li>Remove the roast from the oven and place it aside to rest. Place the roasting pan on the stove, turn the heat to medium-high, and add the stock and wine, scraping any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Let simmer until reduced about 1\/3, and then remove from heat, Pour through a fine sieve and season to taste with salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce.<\/li><li>To make a French Dip sandwich, carve the roast into thin slices. Lightly toast two pieces of bread (either rolls or slices), covering one with Swiss cheese to melt. Spread one piece with mayonnaise, the other with prepared horseradish. Add slices of beef, and place halves of sandwich together. Serve with a small bowl of jus for dipping.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/div><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is no better sandwich than a French Dip.\u00a0Making one requires a well-cooked roast beef, with a dark flavorful &#8220;jus&#8221; in which to dip the..<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1679,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[178,16],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/img_1488.jpg","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/386"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=386"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/386\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1777,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/386\/revisions\/1777"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1679"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=386"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=386"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=386"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
