After living many years in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she moved to Santa Barbara, California. She loved to frequent a small taco stand called La Super-Rica Taqueria just a bit further down Highway 101 from Santa Barbara. We&#8217;d often stop at Super-Rica on trips between San Diego and San Luis Obispo.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"hrecipe h-recipe jetpack-recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\"><h3 class=\"p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Horchata<\/h3><ul class=\"jetpack-recipe-meta\"><li class=\"jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield\" itemprop=\"recipeYield\"><strong>Servings: <\/strong>4<\/li><li class=\"jetpack-recipe-print\"><a href=\"#\">Print<\/a><\/li><\/ul><div class=\"jetpack-recipe-content\"><\/p>\n\n\n<p>When eating Mexican food, I sometimes find it hard to choose between a cold beer and a creamy, icy horchata to wash down a plate of carnitas, but at Super-Rica, the horchata wins hands down.

Do the same with the other half of the ingredients. Strain through 1 layer of cheesecloth.<\/li><li>If it seems too thick for your taste, strain through 2 or 3 layers of cheesecloth, as desired. Add sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon stick. It is better if left overnight again to \u201cimprove,\u201d as it gets richer in flavor.
