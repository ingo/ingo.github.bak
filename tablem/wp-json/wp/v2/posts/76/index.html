Score fat to create a diamond pattern on surface. Cut a piece of aluminum foil to match the shape of the scored area and place over cut area.<\/p>\n<p>Cover a roasting pan with foil, and place ham on wire rack, scored side up, inside pan. Bake ham until scores are pronounced. Remove ham from oven, brush with glaze and return to oven, replacing foil. Bake 2 1\/2 hours more. Remove foil from surface and roast, basting with pan drippings a few times until a meat thermometer registers 140 degrees (approx. 30 mins more)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A more recent find, cooked with great success.
