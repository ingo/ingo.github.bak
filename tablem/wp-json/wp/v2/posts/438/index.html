It&#8217;s a cross between a regular cream soda and a pear soda. We drank four liters of it in less than a week. The directions here are somewhat terse.

Set aside. Heat 4 1\/2 liters of good water (spring water or filtered tap) over medium heat to a boil. Add sugar and stir to dissolve. Add pears, return to a boil, and remove from heat. Split vanilla bean, scrape seeds and drop seeds and pod into pear mixture. Add Cream of Tartar, stir thoroughly and cover pot. Let steep 30 minutes.<\/li><li>At the end of 30 minutes, taste mixture. If not sweet enough, add more sugar and stir. Place pot in a sink surrounded by cool or ice water and stir until temperature drops to 80 degrees. Place yeast in a small container and cover with lukewarm water. Stir yeast to dissolve and let sit 5 minutes.<\/li><li>Filter pear mixture through 1-2 layers of cheesecloth into another clean container. Add yeast and stir well. Pour mixture into clean bottles using a funnel or a bottle filler. Close bottles tightly and leave at room temperature for 24-48 hours. When the small plastic bottle is quite firm to the press, place all bottles in the refrigerator. Soda will get increasingly carbonated as the days go on, and it&#8217;s suggested you finish the soda in 1-2 weeks.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/div><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I made sodas at home, and the first one I tried was inspired by some fresh ripe organic fruit picked..<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1687,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[165,136,16],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/img_2282.jpg","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/438"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=438"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/438\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1758,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/438\/revisions\/1758"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1687"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=438"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=438"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=438"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
