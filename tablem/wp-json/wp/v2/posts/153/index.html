Add onion and cook until it softens, about 5 minutes. Add the nuts and cook, stirring constantly, until they begin to brown, about 3 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Add the bread crumbs and sage to the onions and toss to mix. Add salt, pepper and scallions and toss to mix. Adjust seasoning. Add parsley, stir, and turn off heat.<\/p>\n<p>Place in large oven-proof container. DO NOT PACK. At this point, you may wrap and place in the refrigerator for up to a day.<\/p>\n<p>Cover with foil (or lid), and bake in oven at 350-400 degrees for 30 minutes. Remove lid and bake 15 minutes more. Serve.<\/p>\n<h3>Note<\/h3>\n<p>When making bread crumbs, for most authentic taste, use San Luis Sourdough (plain), torn into large chunks, and then processed to a coarse consistency in a food processor. San Luis Sourdough can be purchased at Trader Joe&#8217;s (it is the &#8220;house&#8221; sourdough bread).<\/p>\n<h3>Pumpkin Variation<\/h3>\n<p>In 2008, Ingo was trying to whip up a quick version of this stuffing, and got crazy with some pumpkin puree. It&#8217;s now the preferred version. To make, add 1 cup sliced mushrooms with the pine nuts. Let cook 3-5 minutes until the mushrooms release some water. Add 1 cup pumpkin puree and 1\/2 cup heavy cream. Cook until slightly reduced. Proceed as directed, but add 1 tbsp. thyme with the sage, and omit scallions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The quintessential Thanksgiving recipe for us.
