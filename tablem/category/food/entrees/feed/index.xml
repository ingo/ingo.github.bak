<p>Paella is a great dish that also inspires many passions. The version I most often make is tuned a bit to my family’s preferences, in particular the addition of sausage. If you’d like to be truly traditional with ingredients, there are some suggestions at the bottom of the recipe.</p>



<p></p>



<div class="hrecipe h-recipe jetpack-recipe" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Recipe"><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop="name">Paella</h3><ul class="jetpack-recipe-meta"><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop="recipeYield"><strong>Servings: </strong>4-8</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-time">

<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients-title">Ingredients</h4></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">For a 16”/40cm round pan</h3>



<ul id="block-78989f35-0b45-4333-ad27-6f4288edac35"><li><strong>6</strong> cups homemade or low-salt chicken broth; more as needed</li><li><strong>1/2</strong> tsp. saffron</li><li><strong>1</strong> tsp. smoked Spanish paprika</li><li>Salt to taste</li><li><strong>1/4</strong> cup olive oil; more if needed</li><li><strong>4</strong>&nbsp;skin-on chicken bone-in or boneless thighs, chopped in half and seasoned with salt and pepper, or brined for 2 hours in simple saltwater brine (skin-on is better, but skinless is okay)</li><li><strong>1</strong> small head garlic (remove excess papery skins, trim the top, and make a shallow cut around its equator to speed cooking), plus 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li><li><strong>1</strong> medium red bell pepper, roasted, cored, seeded, and cut into 1-inch wide strips</li><li><strong>1 </strong>cup artichoke hearts (frozen artichokes from Trader Joe’s work great)</li><li><strong>3</strong> oz. green beans (about 16), trimmed. If you can get flat green beans, even better</li><li><strong>1</strong> small onion, grated on the largest holes of a box grater</li><li><strong>1</strong> ripe tomato, halved horizontally and grated on the largest holes of a box grater (discard the skin), or 3/4 cup tomato sauce</li><li><strong>2</strong> cups Calsparra/<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Santo-Tomas-Bomba-Rice-Pound/dp/B01N4EDDH4/">Bomba</a>/Arborio rice (Bomba rice is best, if you can get it. Other short-grain rice, like sushi rice, will work okay, but rinse it vigorously)&nbsp;</li><li><strong>1</strong> sprig fresh rosemary</li><li><strong>2</strong> lemons, cut in wedges for garnish</li><li><strong>3-4</strong> links of sausage (chorizo or other sausage), chopped into bite-size pieces.</li><li>alioli (a garlicky mayonnaise for which exist many recipes online. If you are pressed for time, some good mayo + &nbsp;crushed garlic + lemon juice + a little salt works as a reasonable substitute, if not authentic)</li><li>3.5 lbs. of charcoal briquets. Yes, weighing them helps with&nbsp;reproducibility of the recipe time after time, especially when using a charcoal grill. I learned this trick from Alton Brown.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><br>For a 14”/30cm round pan:</h3>



<ul id="block-28a18170-46cb-4827-9172-7229c55db323"><li><strong>4</strong> cups homemade or low-salt chicken broth; more as needed</li><li><strong>1/4</strong> tsp. saffron</li><li><strong>2/3</strong> tsp. smoked Spanish paprika</li><li><strong>1 1/4</strong> cups Calsparra/Bomba rice</li><li><strong>everything else, use about 1/3 less</strong></li></ul>



<p></div></p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-directions e-instructions"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-directions-title">Directions</h4></p>



<ol id="block-925acc77-f3d0-47b9-b40a-dba2544b9b18"><li>If using a grill, light ~20-30 briquets (~1.5 lbs.) and allow them to burn nicely. If using the stove, set the pan&nbsp;over your largest burner (or over two burners) on medium heat, noticing if the pan sits level. (If not, choose another burner or try to create a level surface.)</li><li>In a saucepan, bring the broth to a boil; reduce the heat to a simmer and cover. Add the saffron and the smoked paprika to the broth. Taste; the broth should be well seasoned, so add more salt if necessary. Remove from the heat until ready to add to the rice.</li><li>Add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the chicken skin-side down and the head of garlic; sauté until the chicken is golden. The oil may splatter, so be careful. Transfer the partially cooked chicken to a platter. Leave the head of garlic in the pan.</li><li>Reduce the heat to medium low. Slowly sauté the artichokes and green beans in the same pan, until the artichokes are golden and tender, and the beans are soft and slightly wrinkled, 10 minutes. When the artichokes and green beans are done, push them to the perimeter of the pan where there&#8217;s less heat (or transfer them to the platter with the chicken.)</li><li>If you like, you can pause here for a bit and wait until you are about 40 minutes out from dinner before proceeding.</li><li>When ready to proceed, add the remaining ~40-50 briquettes (2.5 lbs.). If your fire died, relight the briquettes.</li><li>Bring the broth back to a simmer if it has cooled down.</li><li>If there&#8217;s more than 1 tablespoon of oil in the pan, pour out the excess.</li><li>Increase the heat to medium and sauté the grated onion and sliced garlic until the onion is soft (it&#8217;s all right if it gets slightly brown), about 5 minutes. Add the grated tomato. Season well with salt and sauté until the water from the tomato has cooked out and the mixture, called a sofrito, has darkened to a burgundy color and is a very thick purée, 5 to 10 minutes.&nbsp;</li><li>Add the rice, stirring until it&#8217;s translucent, 1 to 2 minutes.</li><li>Spread out the rice (it should just blanket the bottom of the pan), distribute the green beans and artichokes evenly, and arrange the chicken and sausage in the pan. Increase the heat to medium high and pour in 5 cups of the simmering broth (reserving 1 cup). As the broth comes to a boil, lay the peppers in the pan, starburst-like, and push the head of garlic to the center. Cook until the rice begins to appear above the liquid, 6 to 8 minutes, rotating the pan over one and two burners as necessary to distribute the heat to all areas. Add the sprig of rosemary and reduce the heat to medium low.</li><li>When the majority of the stock has been absorbed and small holes appear between the rice, you can lay on additional quicker-cooking items such as shrimp, peas, etc.</li><li>Continue to simmer, rotating the pan as necessary, until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is al dente, another 8 to 10 minutes. To check for doneness, taste a grain just below the top layer of rice-there should be a very tiny white dot in the center. If the liquid is absorbed but the rice is not done, add a bit more hot broth or water to the pan and cook a few minutes more.</li><li>Cover the pan with foil or cover the grill and cook gently for another 2 minutes, which will help to ensure that the top layer of rice is evenly cooked.</li><li>Depending on your heat source, this is tricky. If you can adjust the heat source up, and with the cover/foil still in place, increase the heat to medium high and, turning the pan, cook until the bottom layer of rice starts to caramelize, creating the socarrat, 1 to 2 minutes. You may hear the rice crackling, which is fine, but if it starts burning, remove the pan from the heat immediately. To check for socarrat, peel back the foil and use a spoon to feel for a slight crust on the bottom of the pan. If you are using a charcoal grill, hopefully you had the fire hot enough&nbsp;to start with that it will naturally carry it all the way to the perfect level of doneness. If not, you can use the oven or stove to toast the bottom a little, or just start with a bit more briquettes next time. It will still taste great.</li><li>Remove the pan from the heat and let the paella rest, still covered, 10 minutes. Sit everyone down at a round or square table, if possible. Remove the foil, and invite people to eat directly from the pan, starting at the perimeter and working toward the center, squeezing lemon over their section if they like. Serve with&nbsp;alioli and some nice red wine.</li></ol>



<p></div></p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-notes"></p>



<ul><li>This calls for a 16”/40cm round pan. <span class="s1">If you don’t&nbsp;have a traditional pan, find a different flat-bottomed plan with approximately the same surface area</span></li><li>You can also make this on the stove, in the oven, or on a gas grill. Preheat the oven to around 350F/176C degrees. Choose a similar temperature for a gas grill</li><li>The traditional paella Valencia would likely add Rabbit,&nbsp;Garrofó Beans, flat green beans and remove the red bell pepper and sausage</li><li>Adding peas is good. Add frozen ones towards the very end so they stay green</li><li>Use a different broth (i.e. fish or crab) and use seafood instead.</li><li>If you actually have grape vine clippings to add to the fire, awesome! It’s traditional to cook over <a href="https://app.ckbk.com/recipe/movi64691c11s001r004/la-paella">grape vines</a>.</li><li>Completely optional for saffron preparation. Better, but not necessary:&nbsp;Put the saffron on a 3-inch-wide strip of aluminum foil, fold up the foil to make a square packet, and set the foil directly on the lid of the simmering broth for about 15 minutes. Unfold the packet, transfer the saffron to a mortar (or a small bowl), add a pinch of salt, and use the pestle (or the back of spoon) to crush the saffron. Add about 1/2 cup of the hot broth to the saffron and let the saffron steep for about 15 minutes.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span class="leadin">This recipe was discovered after a search for something to cook in a brand-new Staub cast-iron pan I picked up at a steal from Amazon. The little recipe booklet that comes with the pan has a great many photos of whole chickens being roasted inside, but the recipes all in the end called for chicken parts. Staged photos indeed! Fortunately, I ran across this fantastic recipe from the site <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.cyberbilly.com/meathenge/" target="_blank">Meathenge</a> for <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.cyberbilly.com/meathenge/archives/000887.html" target="_blank">&#8220;Wet Roast Chicken&#8221;</a> perfect for my cast iron pot. Here is the recipe with minor modifications, and many thanks to Dr. Biggles. We served it with a parsnip-pumpkin puree.</span><br></p>



<div class="hrecipe h-recipe jetpack-recipe" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Recipe"><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop="name">Roast Chicken with Mushroom Sauce</h3><ul class="jetpack-recipe-meta"><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop="recipeYield"><strong>Servings: </strong>4</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-print"><a href="#">Print</a></li></ul><div class="jetpack-recipe-content"></p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients-title">Ingredients</h4></p>

<p></div></p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-directions e-instructions"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-directions-title">Directions</h4></p>



<ol><li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place rack on bottom shelf.</li><li>Remove giblets from chicken.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span class="leadin">There is no better sandwich than a French Dip. Making one requires a well-cooked roast beef, with a dark flavorful &#8220;jus&#8221; in which to dip the sandwich. Growing up, Ingo would often ask his dad to make the roast beef, slice it thinly, and then pile it high on two slices of San Luis Sourdough bread for a special French Dip treat. This recipe for roast beef comes by way of the Culinary Institute of America&#8217;s The New Professional Chef. The method is fairly foolproof, and yields a good roast with a large pink center &#8211; perfect for a French Dip.</span></p>



<div class="hrecipe h-recipe jetpack-recipe" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Recipe"><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop="name">Roast Beef Au Jus</h3><ul class="jetpack-recipe-meta"><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop="recipeYield"><strong>Servings: </strong>3-4 lbs.</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-print"><a href="#">Print</a></li></ul><div class="jetpack-recipe-content"></p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients-title">Ingredients</h4></p>



<ul><li>1 4-5 beef roast, top sirloin preferred</li><li>1 tsp. olive oil</li><li>1 clove garlic</li><li>1 tsp. salt</li><li>1/2 tsp. pepper</li><li>1/2 onion</li><li>1 stalk celery</li><li>1 carrot</li><li>1 tbsp. Worcestershire Sauce</li><li>1 quart beef stock</li><li>1/4 cup dry red wine</li></ul>



<p></div></p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-directions e-instructions"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-directions-title">Directions</h4></p>



<ol><li>Preheat the oven to 300 F.</li><li>Tie the roast with kitchen twine at 1-2&#8243; intervals to create an evenly-shaped package. Mash the garlic into a paste and coat the roast. Season all over with salt and pepper.</li><li>Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan and brown the roast on all sides. Place the roast in a roasting pan on a wire rack in the oven, and roast until the beef reaches an internal temperature of 100 F. Meanwhile, chop the onion, celery and carrots into a medium dice. Once the roast reaches 100 degrees, add the onion, celery and carrot mixture to the pan along with 1 cup of water. Return the pan to the oven, and continue roasting until the internal temperature reaches 125 F. If the water evaporates, add another cup.</li><li>Remove the roast from the oven and place it aside to rest. Place the roasting pan on the stove, turn the heat to medium-high, and add the stock and wine, scraping any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Let simmer until reduced about 1/3, and then remove from heat, Pour through a fine sieve and season to taste with salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce.</li><li>To make a French Dip sandwich, carve the roast into thin slices. Lightly toast two pieces of bread (either rolls or slices), covering one with Swiss cheese to melt. Spread one piece with mayonnaise, the other with prepared horseradish. Add slices of beef, and place halves of sandwich together. Serve with a small bowl of jus for dipping.</li></ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span class="leadin">We recently picked up a package of frozen lamb chops from Trader Joe&#8217;s and tried this recipe. It was a definite winner. The tart cherries, balsamic vinegar and port combined together to make an exceptionally tasty dressing. The sauce is not complicated, and the whole dish comes together relatively quickly.</span></p>



<div class="hrecipe h-recipe jetpack-recipe" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Recipe"><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop="name">Lamb Chops with Cherry-Port Reduction</h3><ul class="jetpack-recipe-meta"><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop="recipeYield"><strong>Servings: </strong>2</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-print"><a href="#">Print</a></li></ul><div class="jetpack-recipe-content"></p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients-title">Ingredients</h4></p>



<ul><li>2 tsp. olive oil</li><li>4 4-to 5-ounce loin lamb chops</li><li>1/3 cup chopped shallots</li><li>3/4 cup ruby Port</li><li>1/2 cup low-salt chicken broth</li><li>1/2 cup dried tart cherries (we used Montmorency cherries from Costco)</li><li>3 tbsp. cherry or raspberry jam</li><li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</li><li>chopped fresh mint or parsley</li><li>salt</li><li>pepper</li></ul>

<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-directions e-instructions"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-directions-title">Directions</h4></p>



<ol><li>Heat the olive oil in a heavy saucepans over medium heat. Season the lamb chops on all sides with salt and pepper. Cook the chops, turning often, until they reach the desired doneness, approximately 10 minutes. Remove the chops and keep warm under foil.</li><li>Pour off any extra oil from the pan and add the shallots, sautéing 1 minute. Add port, chicken broth, cherries, jam, vinegar and cardamom to shallots and simmer until thickened to a thin syrup. Season with salt and pepper. Plate lamb and pour sauce over the top, sprinkling with parsley or mint, if desired.</li></ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span class="leadin">This dish is inspired by a recipe from Tyler Florence on a show featuring one-dish meals. It&#8217;s very easy to do, relatively quick to prepare, and requires only a single pan. We use cipollini onions, but shallots work just as well. You can use any mushrooms you like for the recipe. We&#8217;ve tried crimini, shitaki, and chanterelles.</span></p>



<div class="hrecipe h-recipe jetpack-recipe" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Recipe"><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop="name">Pan-Roasted Chicken Cipollini</h3><ul class="jetpack-recipe-meta"><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop="recipeYield"><strong>Servings: </strong>2-3</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-print"><a href="#">Print</a></li></ul><div class="jetpack-recipe-content"></p>



<p>If changing mushrooms, you may wish to alter the fresh herbs to suit. Rosemary can overpower chanterelles, so thyme might be more appropriate.</p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients-title">Ingredients</h4></p>



<ul><li>1 shallot</li><li>1/2 split chicken breasts (skin on)</li><li>1-2 cups mushrooms, cleaned and cut into halves or quarters, depending on the size</li><li>1 1/2 cups cipollini onions or shallots, brushed of dirt and cut in half crosswise</li><li>1 tbsp. chopped rosemary or thyme</li><li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li><li>1/4 cup chicken stock</li><li>2 tsp. Dijon mustard</li><li>salt</li><li>pepper</li></ul>



<p></div></p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-directions e-instructions"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-directions-title">Directions</h4></p>



<ol><li>If you have time, brine the chicken breasts in advance. This is unnecessary if they are Kosher chicken breasts, as they are already reaonably seasoned from the Koshering process. Heat the oven to 350 F. Wash and dry the chicken breast, seasoning both sides with salt and pepper.</li><li>Heat a heavy 10-12&#8243; ovenproof skillet on medium heat . Add 1 tbsp. of the oil and place the chicken breasts skin-side down in the pan. Meanwhile, toss the mushrooms, onions and herbs with the remaining oil in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Once the chicken breasts have turned light gold on the bottom, distribute the onion-mushroom mixture evenly around the pan. Place in the oven and cook 20-30 minutes or until the chicken breasts register 160 F using an instant-read thermometer.</li><li>Carefully remove the pan from the oven, empty the contents into a covered container, and pour of most of the extra oil. Heat the pan over the stove and pour in the chicken stock, scraping the pan bottom to loosen the caramelized bits. Once the chicken stock is simmering, whisk in the Dijon mustard and simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly. Plate the chicken breast with the onion-mushroom mixture and pour the sauce over the top.</li></ol>

<p><span class="leadin">In America, we think of blintzes as crepes filled with cheese served best in old-fashioned Jewish delis. In Russia, the word blintz refers to the crepe itself. A traditional meal at any Russian table, blintzes are a special treat that can be enjoyed in a variety of ways, whether served by themselves, paired with caviar, or filled with a sweet or savory stuffing.</span></p>



<div class="hrecipe h-recipe jetpack-recipe" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Recipe"><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop="name">Chicken-Filled Blintzes</h3><ul class="jetpack-recipe-meta"><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop="recipeYield"><strong>Servings: </strong>24 blintzes</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-print"><a href="#">Print</a></li></ul><div class="jetpack-recipe-content"></p>



<p>This recipe takes a traditional chicken stuffing and adds an ingredient our family discovered in California–jicama–to add a nice texture to the mixture.</p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients-title">Ingredients</h4></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blintzes</h3>



<ul><li>5 cups milk</li><li>2 cups flour</li><li>4 eggs</li><li>3 tbsp. vegetable oil</li><li>1 tsp. salt</li><li>1/4 cup sugar</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><br>Filling</h3>



<ul><li>4 cups cooked chicken (breast or thigh meat is fine)</li><li>2 medium onions</li><li>4 medium carrots</li><li>1/4-1/2 of a medium sized jicama</li><li>1/2 cup chicken broth or water</li><li>2 tsp. herb seasoning (Mrs. Dash or similar), or 1 tbsp. fresh chopped herbs (dill, thyme, parsley or combination thereof)</li><li>salt</li><li>pepper</li></ul>



<p></div></p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-directions e-instructions"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-directions-title">Directions</h4></p>



<ol><li>Whisk eggs, sugar, oil and salt in medium bowl. Whisk in milk. Add flour and stir enough to remove most lumps. Cover bowl and place in refrigerator 20 or more minutes.</li><li>Remove mixture from refrigerator and heat a 8&#8243; saucepan over medium heat. Oil the pan and when a drop of water will skip across the surface of the pan, ladle a small amount of the batter into the pan, swirling it so it coats the entire bottom. Once the bottom has browned, flip over and cook the other side until golden spots appear. Flip onto a plate, lightly-oil the pan again, and repeat the process. </li><li>To make the filling, pulse chicken in food processor with steel blade attachment several times until finely minced. Set aside. Peel, dice and fry onion until golden brown. Peel carrots and jicama. Shred the carrots and jicama in food processor or with a grater, and add to onion mixture. Stir to combine. Add salt, pepper, and herbs and saute on low heat for 15 minutes or until carrots are soft. Pulse onion-carrot mixture in a food processor with steel blade several times until finely minced. Mix with chicken, and add chicken broth if too dry. It should be able to clump together.</li><li>To form blintzes, take a blintz and place it in front of you. Add 1 1/2-2 tbsp. filling in in a horizontal sausage shape 1/3 of the way up from the bottom edge. Fold bottom edge of blintz over filling, and then fold both sides inwards. Roll blintz forward until closed. Set aside and repeat with remaining blintzes.</li><li>To serve, heat oil in a saucepan, and place blintzes, seam side down on low heat. Press to flatten. Once golden crust has formed on one side, flip and fry other side until golden. Serve immediately with a choice of toppings such as dill or sour cream.</li></ol>

<p><span class="leadin">Bella Veitzman learned this colorful, joyful recipe from her mom and aunt in Ukraine. It was served (vegetarian-style) at her wedding.</span></p>



<div class="hrecipe h-recipe jetpack-recipe" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Recipe"><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop="name">Stuffed Bell Peppers</h3><ul class="jetpack-recipe-meta"><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop="recipeYield"><strong>Servings: </strong>8</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-print"><a href="#">Print</a></li></ul><div class="jetpack-recipe-content"></p>



<p>Bella&#8217;s special trick is to use buckwheat rather than rice for a fluffier stuffing with a wonderful taste.</p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients-title">Ingredients</h4></p>



<ul id="block-d9cf6408-8380-4d25-accc-953f3c7a93bb"><li>8 medium-sized bell peppers (any color, red or yellow preferred)</li><li>1 1/2 lbs. ground beef</li><li>3 medium onions, finely chopped</li><li>2 1/2-3 lbs. carrots</li><li>1 1/2 cups cooked rice or buckwheat</li><li>1 tbsp. dried herbs (parsley, dill, thyme, oregano)</li><li>2 tbsp. ketchup</li><li>2-3 tbsp. olive or canola oil</li><li>salt</li><li>pepper</li></ul>



<p></div></p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-directions e-instructions"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-directions-title">Directions</h4></p>



<ol><li>Saute onions with oil in large non-stick pan over medium heat until golden brown. Reserve 1/3 of the cooked onions in a separate bowl. Meanwhile, peel carrots, cut off tops and shred with a grater or a food processor. Add carrots to onions with 1 tbsp. salt, dried herbs, and pepper and stir to combine. Cover and cook over low heat 20 minutes or until carrots start to become tender. If necessary, add 1/2 cup of water to moisten the mixture. Add ketchup to mixture and stir to combine. Cook another 5 minutes and remove from heat. Remove carrots from pan into bowl and place pan aside for later reuse.</li><li>Cut tops out of bell peppers and scrape insides to remove seeds. Heat a large pot of water to boiling, and submerge peppers, boiling 4-5 minutes until flexible. Remove from water and drain. Save several cups of the cooking water.</li><li>In large bowl, combine meat with grains, reserved onion, and 1/4 of the cooked carrot mixture. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mix thoroughly. Stuff mixture into peppers, taking care not to over-stuff the peppers, and place the peppers into the previously-saved carrot pan. It is best if you can place the peppers in a single layer. Fill the pan with the reserved water until it reaches approximately half-way up the sides of the peppers. Add 1 tsp. of salt to the water and shake the pan to dissolve. Cover, bring to boil on high heat, turn heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the rest of the carrot mixture over the top of the peppers and cook for another 10 minutes.</li><li>Best served hot or warm.</li></ol>



<p></div></p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-notes"></p>



<p>The peppers can be stuffed with carrots only for a vegetarian-style dish. This can be served warm or cold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span class="leadin">This cheese was a large part of the Veitzman diet in Ukraine, but there was no need to make it regularly, since it was readily available. Unable to buy the kind of Farmer&#8217;s Cheese they were accustomed to once the Veitzman family came to the United States, making it has become a staple around the family household.</span></p>



<div class="hrecipe h-recipe jetpack-recipe" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Recipe"><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop="name">Tvorog</h3><ul class="jetpack-recipe-meta"><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop="recipeYield"><strong>Servings: </strong>5 cups</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-print"><a href="#">Print</a></li></ul><div class="jetpack-recipe-content"></p>



<p>Tvorog resembles ricotta in texture, it can be used in a similar fashion. You can whip it into a smooth paste with a food processor, or use it as a stuffing for blintzes, pastas or pastries. It keeps a week in the refrigerator, but it tastes most special right after it has been made.</p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients-title">Ingredients</h4></p>



<ul id="block-3db8a7f6-65d2-45f0-b003-4a07838c16ba"><li>1 gallon milk (we prefer 2% organic milk, but any kind is fine)</li><li>1-2 quarts buttermilk</li><li>one 5-6 gallon enamel pot</li><li>cheesecloth</li></ul>



<p></div></p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-directions e-instructions"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-directions-title">Directions</h4></p>



<ol><li>Mix milk and buttermilk together in the enamel pot. If you have enough volume in your pot, you may use more than 1 quart of buttermilk&#8211;the resulting flavor will be a little more sour. Cover with lid and sit at room temperature for up to 24 hours, or until thickened into a yogurt-like consistency.</li><li>Place mixture in pot on stove covered on very low heat. After 15-20 minutes, the curds will start to separate from the whey.  Once it starts to separate, stir mixture once to remove any hot spots. Continue to cook another 15 minutes, and stir once more. Cook another 15 minutes or so until the curds float to the top in a mass.</li><li>Place cheesecloth in a single layer on the inside of a colander. Pour the mixture into the colander slowly, trying to pour the whey out before the curds. If you like, you can save the whey as it&#8217;s quite healthy to use in other recipes. The liquid at this point should be yellowish and clear. If it&#8217;s still cloudy, leave the pot covered on the stove 20 minutes or until the mixture reaches room temperature and then resume the procedure.</li><li>Cover the mixture in the colander and let drain at room temperature for four or more hours, up to overnight. The cheese is now ready. You can invert the colander onto a plate and peel off the cheesecloth to remove the cheese.</li><li>This cheese is great served savory or sweet, mixed with source cream, yogurt or berries. It can be spread on bread with a topping of herbs. It&#8217;s also great as a filling for piroshkis or blintzes. It is similar to ricotta and can be used as a substitute.</li></ol>

<p>Some people tire of turkey sandwiches quickly, but usually the turkey&#8217;s gone long before we&#8217;d like it to be.</p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-ingredients-title">Ingredients</h4></p>



<ul id="block-ee2d0d5c-bc6b-4344-b9c5-f81b40da0325"><li><a href="/food/roast-turkey-with-oranges-and-onions/" data-type="post" data-id="111">Roast Turkey With Oranges And Onions</a> or <a href="/food/smoked-turkey/" data-type="post" data-id="116">Smoked Turkey</a></li><li><a href="/food/stuffing-with-pine-nuts/" data-type="post" data-id="153">Stuffing With Pine Nuts</a></li><li><a href="/food/cranberry-orange-relish/" data-type="post" data-id="151">Cranberry Orange Relish</a></li><li>Mustard</li><li>Mayonnaise</li><li>2 slices San Luis Sourdough</li><li>cheese (optional)</li></ul>



<p></div></p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-directions e-instructions"><h4 class="jetpack-recipe-directions-title">Directions</h4></p>



<p>Toast the bread. Spread one side with cranberry relish and mustard. Spread other side with mayonnaise. If using cheese, place on one slice of bread and broil quickly to melt. If turkey is cold, mix with a little gravy and microwave on low power for a minute or two to warm and moisten. Place turkey and stuffing on one side of bread. Top with other side.</p>



<p></div></p>



<p><div class="jetpack-recipe-notes"></p>



<p>Add a little horseradish, a little dab of gravy, or tomatoes.</p>
