					<description><![CDATA[I planted a basil plant oudsite this year, next to my house.  I absolutely loved having the fresh basil for cooking, and the plant grew to be huge. Of course, it has now succumbed to our first frost, but will definitely have it again next year, and would be interested in seeing how it works for others having it inside in a pot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joyce,I&#039;m sure you will love it   Hmmm, I think it probably took about half an hour, but I was worinkg on other things while the milk heated up and the curds drained. I also will skip the curd rinsing step in the future and that will reduce the time too. If you are worinkg in the kitchen on another project that doesn&#039;t require constant attention, you can multi-task and make your cottage cheese at the same time. I started heating the milk on the stove top, then mixed up a batch of muffins from my home made mix. After I put the muffins in the oven, the milk was just about hot enough that gave me a minute to wipe down the counters and get my colander ready for the cheese. While the cheese was draining, I pulled the muffins out and put them on the racks to cool. The first time you make cheese, you might want to concentrate on just that. Once you&#039;ve got the experience under you belt, multi-task away!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made these 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of /2 white, becasue it&#039;s all I had in the house. Very, very good! Next time I will flatten the them a little before cooking, as they didn&#039;t spread much, but I&#039;ll definitely make them again. I try to limit my sweets to something every couple of weeks and make it as healthy as I can. These fit the bill very nicely. Thanks Susan! Don&#039;t know what i&#039;d do without your site.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the idea of a baking day, and given that we suvirved without an oven for nearly a year (gasp!) I think it should be instated starting now. We had a gas stove that worked fine, but the stove components were electrical so the temp, time etc couldn&#039;t be programmed but now we have a new gas stove and my boys love baking too thanks for the inspiration!~Erin]]></description>
