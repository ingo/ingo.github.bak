					<description><![CDATA[I love the idea of a baking day, and given that we suvirved without an oven for nearly a year (gasp!) I think it should be instated starting now. We had a gas stove that worked fine, but the stove components were electrical so the temp, time etc couldn&#039;t be programmed but now we have a new gas stove and my boys love baking too thanks for the inspiration!~Erin]]></description>
