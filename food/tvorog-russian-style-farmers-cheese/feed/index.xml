					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joyce,I&#039;m sure you will love it   Hmmm, I think it probably took about half an hour, but I was worinkg on other things while the milk heated up and the curds drained. I also will skip the curd rinsing step in the future and that will reduce the time too. If you are worinkg in the kitchen on another project that doesn&#039;t require constant attention, you can multi-task and make your cottage cheese at the same time. I started heating the milk on the stove top, then mixed up a batch of muffins from my home made mix. After I put the muffins in the oven, the milk was just about hot enough that gave me a minute to wipe down the counters and get my colander ready for the cheese. While the cheese was draining, I pulled the muffins out and put them on the racks to cool. The first time you make cheese, you might want to concentrate on just that. Once you&#039;ve got the experience under you belt, multi-task away!]]></description>
