Hi Kristen...kompote seems to keep about a week or so, but frankly, we&#039;ve always finished it sooner than that. I think it would still be okay after a week, but the fruit might start fermenting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It has been so long since I had Kompote--I had forgotten just how good it was until I came across your recipe and it jogged my memory.  I&#039;ll definately be trying this recipe out, but I did have a question: how long does it keep for?  Can I store it indefinately?  Or does it have a distinct shelf-life?]]></description>
