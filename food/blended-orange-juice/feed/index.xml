					<description><![CDATA[Oh my god, shut up stupid (referring to the previous poster). Americans are not fat! Some are, but America has really done a lot to change that. I don&#039;t know other countries that continuously play the same &quot;Get Fit&quot; ads over, and over, and OVER again. We Americans are willing to change! So before you open your huge mouth about this, think of what we&#039;re trying to do. :P So everytime that annoying &quot;The Big Help&quot; from Nickelodeon comes on, think of what we&#039;re trying to do. Stop kids from becoming fat and gross.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad this was posted. I remember drinking this when I was a youngen. It was delicious. Yet, I&#039;m sure it has tons of sugar. Which leads to fat... And after so much fat, you get the average American! :D Good thing too. So thank goodness this recipe is on here &#039;cause I know if it makes you fat, Americans will drink it. Bye bye!]]></description>
