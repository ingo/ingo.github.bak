					<description><![CDATA[I made these 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of /2 white, becasue it&#039;s all I had in the house. Very, very good! Next time I will flatten the them a little before cooking, as they didn&#039;t spread much, but I&#039;ll definitely make them again. I try to limit my sweets to something every couple of weeks and make it as healthy as I can. These fit the bill very nicely. Thanks Susan! Don&#039;t know what i&#039;d do without your site.]]></description>
