The little recipe booklet that comes with the pan has a great many photos of whole chickens being roasted inside, but the recipes all in the end called for chicken parts. Staged photos indeed! Fortunately, I ran across this fantastic recipe from the site <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyberbilly.com\/meathenge\/\" target=\"_blank\">Meathenge<\/a> for <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyberbilly.com\/meathenge\/archives\/000887.html\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Wet Roast Chicken&#8221;<\/a> perfect for my cast iron pot. Here is the recipe with minor modifications, and many thanks to Dr. Biggles. We served it with a parsnip-pumpkin puree.<\/span><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"hrecipe h-recipe jetpack-recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\"><h3 class=\"p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Roast Chicken with Mushroom Sauce<\/h3><ul class=\"jetpack-recipe-meta\"><li class=\"jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield\" itemprop=\"recipeYield\"><strong>Servings: <\/strong>4<\/li><li class=\"jetpack-recipe-print\"><a href=\"#\">Print<\/a><\/li><\/ul><div class=\"jetpack-recipe-content\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><div class=\"jetpack-recipe-ingredients\"><h4 class=\"jetpack-recipe-ingredients-title\">Ingredients<\/h4><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>1 4 lb. roasting chicken<\/li><li>1 medium onion, diced<\/li><li>2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1\/4&#8243; rounds<\/li><li>2 stalks celery, diced<\/li><li>4 cloves garlic, smashed with the side of a knife<\/li><li>3-4 cups chicken stock<\/li><li>1\/2 lb. mushrooms, cleaned and chopped in half<\/li><li>3 tbsp. olive oil, 2 for pot, 1 for chicken<\/li><li>2 tsp. paprika<\/li><li>salt<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/div><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><div class=\"jetpack-recipe-directions e-instructions\"><h4 class=\"jetpack-recipe-directions-title\">Directions<\/h4><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
