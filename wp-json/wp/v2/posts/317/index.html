This is unnecessary if they are Kosher chicken breasts, as they are already reaonably seasoned from the Koshering process. Heat the oven to 350 F. Wash and dry the chicken breast, seasoning both sides with salt and pepper.<\/li><li>Heat a heavy 10-12&#8243; ovenproof skillet on medium heat . Add 1 tbsp. of the oil and place the chicken breasts skin-side down in the pan. Meanwhile, toss the mushrooms, onions and herbs with the remaining oil in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Once the chicken breasts have turned light gold on the bottom, distribute the onion-mushroom mixture evenly around the pan. Place in the oven and cook 20-30 minutes or until the chicken breasts register 160 F using an instant-read thermometer.<\/li><li>Carefully remove the pan from the oven, empty the contents into a covered container, and pour of most of the extra oil. Heat the pan over the stove and pour in the chicken stock, scraping the pan bottom to loosen the caramelized bits. Once the chicken stock is simmering, whisk in the Dijon mustard and simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly. Plate the chicken breast with the onion-mushroom mixture and pour the sauce over the top.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/div><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This dish is inspired by a recipe from Tyler Florence on a show featuring one-dish meals.
