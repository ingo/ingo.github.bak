We generally make two recipes, and then freeze half of the tamales. They keep frozen very well.<\/p>\n<h3>Ingredients<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1\/2 cup milk<\/li>\n<li>1 1\/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons fresh corn kernels (frozen supersweet work very well)<\/li>\n<li>1 cup masa harina<\/li>\n<li>3\/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons butter, softened<\/li>\n<li>1 tsp. baking powder<\/li>\n<li>1\/2 tsp. salt<\/li>\n<li>corn husks, soaked in hot water<\/li>\n<li>1\/2 cup shredded jack cheese<\/li>\n<li>1\/2 cup finely diced raosted green chiles<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Directions<\/h3>\n<p>Simmer the milk and corn together over medium heat for approximately 5 minutes. Strain the corn, reserve 1 cup, and then puree the rest with the milk. Add the puree to the masa harina and mix with a spoon. With a mixer, whip the butter, baking powder and salt together until light and fluffy. In approximately 1\/4 cup increments, whisk the masa into the butter. This should take 10-15 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Divide the masa evenly between the corn husks. Depending on the size, you should be able to get at least 8 tamales. Spead the masa into a small pad in the middle of the corn husk. Top with a little cheese and chile. Fold the tapered end up over the masa, roll, and then tie the top with a piece of corn husk.<\/p>\n<p>Steam for 30 minutes over boiling water. A chinese steamer over a wok works well for this purpose.<\/p>\n<h3>Notes<\/h3>\n<p>Use Carnitas inside. Omit the chile. Cheese is optional.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>These tamales truly benefit from the addition of fresh corn kernels to the masa mix.
