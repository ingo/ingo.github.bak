Kosher salt<\/li>\n<li>4 tbsp. sugar<\/li>\n<li>pepper<\/li>\n<li>freshly-chopped dill<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Directions<\/h3>\n<p>Remove all bones from the salmon fillets. Make sure you get them all. A needle-nose pliers can be useful for removing the last few.<\/p>\n<p>The recipe above is for two pound fillets. Depending on size, multiply ingredient amounts as necessary. Mix salt wit sugar. Apply half to each fillet flesh side, massaging the mixture into the flesh. Flip each fillet over and with a sharp knife, make a slice in the skin every inch across the width of the fillet.<\/p>\n<p>Flip the fish back over on the skin, and season with cracked black pepper and a large handful of dill. Press the two fillets together, flesh-to-flesh, and tightly wrap in aluminum foil. Place a weight on top, and lay on a baking sheet inside the refrigerator for 2 to 5 days. Turn the fillet package every day or so, draining any accumulated liquid.<\/p>\n<p>Once complete, remove the fillets from the aluminum foil, scrape of the dill, and quickly rinse in water. Rub dry and place in refrigerator, skin side down, uncovered, until the top of the flesh is dry and glossy. Cold smoke for a few hours using a few chunks of hard wood and some smoking &#8220;sawdust&#8221;. Hot smoking will work, but cold smoking tastes better.<\/p>\n<p>Best served with buttered bread and some sliced red onions, perhaps with a little gin or beer to drink.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Smoked salmon, as prepared by Ingo&#8217;s dad<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[178,16],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/54"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=54"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/54\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=54"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=54"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/muschenetz.com\/tablem\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=54"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
