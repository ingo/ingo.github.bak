I had a chocolate sorbet recipe that came with my ice cream machine that I liked, but it was only good, not great, so I went hunting for a new one. And then I came across this one in David Lebovitz&#8217;s <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Perfect-Scoop-Sorbets-Granitas-Accompaniments\/dp\/1580088082\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1230264322&amp;sr=1-1\">The Perfect Scoop<\/a><\/em>. It uses both chopped chocolate and cocoa powder, a combination that reminds me of the fantastic hot chocolate recipe from Pierre Herm\u00e9 in Jeffrey Steingarten&#8217;s <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mustve-Been-Something-I-Ate\/dp\/0375727124\/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1230264290&amp;sr=8-1\">It Must&#8217;ve Been Something I Ate<\/a>.<\/em> I&#8217;m not certain exactly what using both powder and chopped chocolate does chemically, but it results in an incredibly rich concoction&#8211;almost like eating frozen fudge. Once we tried this recipe, we knew we didn&#8217;t have to go searching any further.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"hrecipe h-recipe jetpack-recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\"><h3 class=\"p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Chocolate Sorbet<\/h3><ul class=\"jetpack-recipe-meta\"><li class=\"jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield\" itemprop=\"recipeYield\"><strong>Servings: <\/strong>1 quart<\/li><li class=\"jetpack-recipe-print\"><a href=\"#\">Print<\/a><\/li><\/ul><div class=\"jetpack-recipe-content\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><div class=\"jetpack-recipe-ingredients\"><h4 class=\"jetpack-recipe-ingredients-title\">Ingredients<\/h4><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>2 1\/4 c. water<\/li><li>1 c. sugar<\/li><li>3\/4 c. unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder<\/li><li>A pinch of salt<\/li><li>6 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, finely chopped (the bittersweet Pound Plus bar from Trader Joe&#8217;s is fine)<\/li><li>1\/2 tsp. vanilla extract, or 1\/2 a vanilla bean.
